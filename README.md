# Zoom Eye Tracking System

A Python-based eye-tracking system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and an Arduino distance sensor.
Eye tracking activates when the user is within 60 cm of the camera, using proximity as an
indicator of engagement in online conversations.

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Arduino (distance sensor)

## Purpose
This project explores body language and engagement in online video calls by combining
physical proximity data with real-time eye tracking.
